# hello-world


Hi

I have created the first GitGub repository hello-world.
This is the basic step before getting started with projects inclusion.
I did it by clicking '+' sign, which is at the top left corner of my profile, then clicked 'New repository'.
Gave it a name provided above.
Also created branch named readme-edits.
By default, there is a branch named master.
At present I am working in readme-edits.
